# PokemonWeakStudy
## What is this project?
It was made before, but it is a program consisting of pure C that matches Pokemon's family name.
But I can't do it now. It needs to be fixed a little bit, and it was actually used as a test to get used to GitHub.
## Then how are you going to make a new one?
I'm not thinking about making a new one, but I'm thinking of changing it to Cpp rather than old C.
Or I'm thinking of using JavaScript at all. Or you can use a plutter from what you've studied recently.
